/* BEFORE USING HOME-MANAGER

For this host you need to fix the username problem.
You accidentally configured each host username with uncapitalised letters when the folder is capitalised
in this example. the host 'Entertainer' has the username 'entertainer' when it should be 'Entertainer'
Fixing this issue is going to mess with any manually configured settings on the device and so should only be done with
the time and dedication to fix those issues. Make sure you don't need to use this device soon if you do this.
